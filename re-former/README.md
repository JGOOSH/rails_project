# README

This project is meant to practice basic forms in ruby on rails.
I will build some forms, both using nearly-pure HTML and then graduating to using
the helper methods that Rails provides.

This will cover:
* Integrating a signup form with Rails application
* providing help if the user enters incorrect information
